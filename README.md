# Advance-Healthcare-Data-Analysis-with-SQL
This project is all about exploring healthcare data using SQL. I used PostgreSQL to design tables, clean messy records, and analyze real-world patterns in patient demographics, clinical visits, test results, and billing. It's a hands-on way to understand how raw data can turn into valuable insights in a healthcare setting.
